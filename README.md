# Chessapp
My attempt at writing a console chess app on my own. The code is really messy and no one should look at it but if you want to try playing it and see where it breaks that'd help me :) I cant find where it would break yet

pawns dont turn into queens when they get to the end of the board and you cant have the rook switch spots with the king otherwise it *should* work fine in every situation but probably not
